This app explores the concepts of the Backbone framework and MVC methodology.

There are 3 views now, 24 hours and week. the views / API calls are made each time a new view or location is selected in order to present the most up to date information. As an MVP I chose to just present tempereture and moisture.

I also wanted to explore some more HTML/CSS and JS interactivity here and added some JS to dynamicly change the height of the temp and moisture bars as a reflection of the percentage.

There is some touch up needed with the stying and I need to revisit the 24 hour and week view and finish syncing the heights of the temp and moist with the actuial data.
